Here are some key points for your consideration:

Test Coverage: I want to transparently acknowledge that I didn't cover all unit and integration tests comprehensively. However, I made efforts to showcase my notation skills. Consequently, the code coverage may not be optimal, but I assure you that I'm aware of its importance and am committed to improving it in a production environment.

Performance Considerations: I deliberately utilized an index on the 'status' column, recognizing that this may lead to performance issues with substantial datasets due to its low cardinality. This was a deliberate choice to highlight my awareness of potential pitfalls, and I am prepared to discuss alternative strategies for optimizing performance in a production context.

Adherence to Principles: While I didn't cover all principles, such as HATEOAS, in this test, please be assured that my knowledge and understanding of these concepts are not overlooked. Given the test nature, I focused on specific aspects, but I am fully prepared to integrate these principles into my work when required for real-world applications.

Security Considerations: I acknowledge that I exposed the real database ID, which could pose security concerns in a production environment. However, in the context of this test, I deemed it a lower priority. Rest assured, in a real-world scenario, I would implement more robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss these points further and provide additional context during an interview. Thank you for considering my submission, and I look
